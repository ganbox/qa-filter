Description: 
Plugin for additional filtering of user input during question adding. The plugin supports switchable options in admin panel:
- Prevent question title duplicates;
- Capitalize only the first character of the question title;
- Delete the different types of quotation marks at the start and the end of the question;
- Add a question mark (only one) at the end of the question title if not present (without raising error);
- Search for at least one latin letter (A-Za-z) in the question title (disabled by default);
- Search for at least one cyrillic symbol in the question title (disabled by default).

Localization:
The plugin supports language files. For new language you can copy qa-ganbox-lang-en-GB.php to new file qa-ganbox-lang-xx-XX.php (where xx and XX is your language code) and translate strings after sign "=>" to your language.
